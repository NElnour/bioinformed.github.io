# Context
Writing this blog post was very challenging, mainly because my memory has been hazy for the past few years, and there were probably very few projects for which the destination was worth the journey. I remembered last night that I had kept journals around the time I first immigrated to Canada. I was 15 at the time, acclimating to a new environment and social differences without guidance. As a new immigrant, I took the little things for larger meanings - signals, if you will, of whether I can make it here. 

So, when grade 11 rolled in and there was a classmate who went around labelling me as only "book-smart" and not "life-smart" or "people-smart", I went into panic mode: are my parents' sacrifices going to be for nothing? It also didn't help that *that* year's physics project was assembling a model rocket, which I had worked hard on only to have it not launch at all. The said classmate was right there too since he was responsible for wiring all rockets to the ignition source. After demonstration period was over, I tried re-wiring again, and this time the rocket flew, but there was no one present to record the angle to the apogee. The teacher saw it during slow descent, but since there weren't angle measurements, my mark for the project took a hit, and so did my confidence. I decided to redeem myself in next year's physics project: the catapult.

# Catapults
Catapults are projectile-launching devices historically used as weapons. Propulsion can be achieved via tension or counterweight.
Reading about their history, it was striking how ancient these inventions were: early mentions date back to 750 BC, and they evolved from arrow-firing to wood/coal-firing, boulder-firing, grenade-firing, or human-firing. Today, I went back to search if there were any new advances in their applications, and it turns out there was a cannabis-firing catapult discovered in 2011. Iconic. 

The project had three evaluation categories:

1. **Design quality**: included materials' prices and catapult weight;
2. **Accuracy targetting**: basically hitting a target board;
3. **Long-range shooting**: graded on 5 m brackets, what is the longest projectile range that the catapult can achieve? 

My partner for the project and I had differing views on the kind of catapult we should build. His idea was that since catapults are essentially meant to cause gross, non-specific damage, we should focus on long-range shooting only and build a *trebuchet* (see below). My idea was to build a catapult that functions as a slingshot (the *Leonardo Da Vinci catapult*), because we can achieve accuracy and we do not need a heavy stabilizing base.
