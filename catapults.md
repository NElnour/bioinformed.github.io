# Context
Writing this blog post was very challenging: my memory is hazy and there are probably very few projects for which the destination was worth the journey. I remembered last night that I had kept journals around the time I first immigrated to Canada. As a new immigrant, I took the little things for larger signals of whether I can make it here. 

So, when grade 11 rolled in and there was a classmate who was labeling me as only "book-smart" and not "life-smart" or "people-smart", I was anxious: are my parents' sacrifices going to be for nothing? It also didn't help that *that* year's physics project was assembling a model rocket that failed to launch despite my hard work and its simplicity. The said classmate was right there, too, since he was responsible for wiring all the rockets to the ignition source. After demonstration period was over, I tried re-wiring again, and this time the rocket flew, but there was no one present to record the angle to the apogee. The teacher saw it during slow descent, but without angle measurements my mark took a hit. I decided to redeem myself in next year's physics project: the catapult.

# Catapults
Catapults are projectile-launching devices historically used as weapons.
It was striking how ancient these inventions were: early mentions date back to 750 BC, and they evolved from arrow-firing to wood/coal-firing, boulder-firing, grenade-firing, or human-firing. Today, I searched if there were any new advances in their applications, and it turns out there was a [cannabis-firing catapult](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/drug-catapult-found_n_814840). Iconic. 

Our grade 12 physics project would not launch boulders, arrows, or people - although our physics teacher pulled a mean April fool's prank about how he was going to be suspended and our class cancelled because the Peel board found out we were building weapons. Instead, we were going to be firing foam balls, with the added feature than they can be substituted for snowballs. The project had three evaluation categories:

1. **Design quality**: catapult weight and sturdiness;
2. **Accuracy targeting**: basically hitting a target board;
3. **Long-range shooting**: what is the longest projectile range that the catapult can achieve? 

My partner for the project and I had differing views on the kind of catapult we should build. One idea was a *trebuchet* since catapults are essentially meant to cause gross, non-specific damage (see below, left). Another was to build a sling-shot catapult (the *Leonardo da Vinci catapult*; LdV sling), because we can achieve accuracy and we do not need a heavy stabilizing base (see below, right).

After lengthy discussions, we could not agree. So, we decided to build both and then have a test to see which design would perform better overall. Building a LDV sling was straightforward enough; building a catapult however was a challenge. From choosing a strong yet light wood, distributing the pressure properly across the base, and balancing the counterweight along the frame and beam, we managed to  put it together last minute. It collapsed during our test run, however, leaving us to submit the LdV sling by default. In the end, the LdV sling did really well placing second overall.

# The lessons that be

There were many lessons that I learned from the project. Interpersonally, I learned one way to handle differences in problem-solving approaches. Intrapersonally, I learned to not lose hope from temporary setbacks, and that given the right mind frame, setbacks (verbal and performative) are temporary. Interestingly, while reading about ancient Mongolian catapults I found many mentions that explain historical religious texts I had read beforehand. It really made me wonder just how much of what we attribute to higher power is simply the interconnected dynamics of life that we did not see.
