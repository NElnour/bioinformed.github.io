My name is Nada, and I am a fourth year completing my second degree in bioinfrmatics and computational biology. I developed an interest in the field through systems biology, which in turn I found out about after reading Mitchell Waldrop's *Complexity*.

When I first entered university, the thought of pursuing any computer science-related career had not crossed my mind. The only computer science class I took in high school was a C++ app development type of course, and even then I felt like I did not belong there since I was the only girl. I continued with life science courses until grad school, where I first felt the need to learn a programming language for data analysis. Honestly, it was a steep learning curve, but I eventually got the hang of it and I started to enjoy it.

I decided to pursue a PhD in computational biology (mainly networks and modelling). As is the general case with learning, though, the more you know, the more you realize how much you need to improve. So, now I am back in undergrad to fill in those knowledge gaps.

One of my goals is to improve my intepersonal communication skills. I would love to hear from you, so please feel free to reach out to chat about ~~systems biology/CS~~ snorkeling, acrylic pouring, origami, arduino projects, or just life!
